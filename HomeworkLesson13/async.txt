Before asynchronous programming was not easy but with introduction of
async/await keywords in C# 5 asynchronous programming has become much
easier to work with. 

In asynchronous programming a unit or units of code is implemented separately
from main application thread, which receives notification of completion,
failure or success of it.

Task objects are used nn asynchronous programming and model asynchronous
operations using async and await keywords.

When using asynchronous programming, it is important to use it all the way,
i.e. all callers should be asynchronous. Moreover, it is not advisable to return
void in async methods because if there is an exception thrown the whole process will
stop. When returning a task though, exceptions thrown are wrapped in the returned
Task instead of an actual exception.
